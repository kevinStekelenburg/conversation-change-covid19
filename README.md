# The influence of COVID-19 on football conversations

__To what extent did the twitter conversation of Dutch Football fans change due to COVID-19 (no fans in the stadiums)?__

## Motivation

These are hard financial times for football clubs ,because there are no fans allowed in their stadiums (Grix, Brannagan, Grimes & Neville, 2020). It is important for football clubs to keep their fans engaged with their team to not lose them as fans. As COVID-19 has shifted face to face interactions to digital interactions, social media is now the main source of interaction of fans with their football clubs.
